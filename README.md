# Fall 2020 - University of Texas at Austin
## Relevant assignments and coursework completed for the following courses: 
### ME379M (Data Science for Engineers)
Experential learning course that taught the fundamentals of predictive data science (ML) using practical, industry-focused, minimal guidance approach. 
#### Tasks
Tasks represent the exploratory analysis of each problem, and an attempt at a solution usually within 48 hours of the problem being assigned. This allowed me to learn and explore in an environment similar to that which I expect in industry (minimal guidance, model-driven, time-constrained, etc.). When you look at each task sequentially, you will be able to see the vast improvements made throughout the semester with no incoming knowledge of python or data science.
#### Project
The final project (similar to that of ME369P with approval) was a group effort to make predictions on the number of confirmed cases for each country using the time-series COVID-19 dataset. The results were mixed for different countries but offered some meaningful insights to the data and predictions. We presented our results to industry sponsors and recieved feedback. 5 person team of members of the class.

### ME369P (Application Programming for Engineers)
Python focused course that sought to engage engineers in the world of open-source application building. We started with a crash-course in python including some individual and team assignments to prove our skills; then we moved straight into practical application through the projects phase of the course.
#### Assignments
These were specific tasks on typically 2-week deadlines that were designed to test our knowledge of developing in python as we progressed through the crash course.
#### Project
See ME379M Project description. Presented to the instructor and other students and recieved feedback. 3 Person team of members of the class (no overlap in team members from other project).
